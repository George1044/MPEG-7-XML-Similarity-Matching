Demo for the IDPA Course where we try to do CBIR between 1000 pictures using MPEG-7 Descriptors

The pictures were retreived from http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/related/
The code to extract 6 MPEG-7 descriptors was retreived from https://github.com/mubastan/mpeg7fex

The code extractXML.py reformats the .txt files created by MPEG7Fex into XML files.
The code prettyPrint.py rewrites the XML files in more readable format.
